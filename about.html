<p>Hi, I am <a href="http://twitter.com/akhilrex" target="_blank">Akhil Gupta</a> and this is my tech blog. This is an extension to my primary blog here at <a href="http://akhil.me" target="_blank">akhil.me</a> where I usually talk about life experiences, entrepreneurship and other not so technical matters.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this blog is to have an archive of <a href="/utility/2012/create-html-select-dropdown-for-states-of-any-country/" target="_blank">tools</a>, tips and snippets that I need to use almost everyday. Although I can always search these over the internet I feel it would save me a lot of time if I document the tested methods here. I like to code small tools and utilities for fun as well as work. This is the place where they would be hosted as well.</p>
<p>In case you have a feedback or wish to contribute, you can find me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/akhilrex" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
