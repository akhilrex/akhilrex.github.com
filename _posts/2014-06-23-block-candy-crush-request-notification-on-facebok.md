Every now and then I see someone whining on the Social Media about how they are fed up with constant Candy Crush requests. Although it is super intuitive and easy to block such notifications people sometimes are not able to figure them out. To make it easier for them I am writng this small tutorial. 

This works for all app/games on facebook.
